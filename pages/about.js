          <strong>Hello! I&apos;m Ryan! üëã</strong>
          <p>
            I&apos;m originally from the American Southwest, but I&apos;ve been based out of
            Brooklyn, NY for about 10 years now. I love to build things that make people&apos;s
            lives at least a tiny bit more enjoyable, which is what drew me to working in startup
            operations.

          , but to sum it up: I&apos;ve helped build out Operations and AdOps departments for
          several companies. I specialize in process and automation because I like to hire smart
          people to do smart things and don&apos;t want mundane aspects of the job to keep them
          from it. I&apos;m always on the lookout for my next big project, so please feel free to{" "}

          help you with.

        <h2>My Hobbies üì∏</h2>
        <p>
          A friend once said to me that &quot;having hobbies is your hobby&quot;, which fits
          pretty well. You could probably call me a dilettante. I like to just let myself follow
          whatever spark is interesting me at the moment. In the past few years I&apos;ve dabbled
          in painting, coffee roasting, candle making, making music, electrical engineering, and
          probably a lot more that I&apos;m not remembering.
        </p>

        <p>
          A few that have stuck, however, are{" "}
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/realryanrogers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            photography
          </a>
          , game development, and cooking. And if you count watching TikTok as a hobby, then
          that&apos;s probably at the top of the list.
